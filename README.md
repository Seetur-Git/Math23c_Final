# Math23c_Final

Dari and Edie


There is a branch with the HTML for the simulation. I made it in Game maker studio for web.

here is a link to a wbsite (made form that branch) using netlify: https://math-23c-final.netlify.app/

You can click on a setting to change it. Press space to start the simulation, and escape to get back to the setting screen.
