Questions I might have that I could answer with Dari's evolution model:
-Under what conditions is a gene that confers both increased nutrition to the predator and increased fitness to prey most advantageous to prey?
	-Run model many times and calculate the mean and standard deviation of predator and prey after a certain amount of time has passed.
-What kind of distribution best describes the prevalance of a dominant, advantageous gene during predatory selection? What about a recessive, advantageous gene?
	-Chi-squared test against various distributions
	-Generate a distribution function with variables corresponding to the degree of advantage offered by the gene, which can be used to predict distribution features based on degree of advantage offered.

What models result in one population (either predator or prey) taking over?
What models do not--in other words, which find an equilibrium?

-What's the effect of the genetic of an advantageous gene on predator/prey numbers over time.
